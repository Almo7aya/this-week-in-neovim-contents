# Neovim Core updates

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- [spellsitter merged to core!](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x7k7r7/spellsitter_merged_to_neovim_core/). A
  huge contribution by [@lewis6991] and [@vigoux]. If you did not know, `spellsitter` is a tree-sitter powered spell
  checking mechanism that only checks spells for specified queries. This allows checking only relevant parts such as
  comments or markdown text for spelling errors. ([#19419](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19419))

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

**Plugins supporting [SemVer](https://semver.org) will have a little badge on the right side of their title:
<span class="has-text-grey">SemVer</span> <span class="icon has-text-warning"><span class="fa-solid fa-star"></span></span>
Those plugins help contributing to a more stable Neovim ecosystem, and hence are put in front of others. Thank you!**

Have you ever used `print()` in your plugin code for debugging? This new plugin by [@smartpde] simplifies this use
case - leave log statements in the code and enable them when needed.

Hey, a new terminal plugin! [@Hvassaa] made their very first Neovim plugin, `sterm.nvim`, which stands for (s)tupid
(term)inal. It allows you to toggle between showing and hiding a terminal buffer. Simple, to the point. Congrats on your
first plugin!

Procrastinating instead of doing their university duty, [@raddari] made a fun Neovim plugin to recall your last call to
`:colorscheme`. You can then reuse it as you wish, and even automatically set your colorscheme based on the last
session.

But really, do your homework!

> `inc-rename.nvim` is a small plugin that lets you preview Neovim `vim.lsp.buf.rename` command as you type (nightly
> only). It will highlight all occurrences of the variable in your buffers as you rename it.

![inc_rename.nvim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40792180/188309667-0d7e8086-ae48-4a25-8b01-df11d229b8c6.png)

`inc-rename.nvim` released a new update which adds proper support for the popular
[dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) plugin that enhances the appearance of Neovim's default
`vim.ui.input`. Now, the new name of a variable will be mirrored in `dressing`'s input buffer as you type in the command
line. There is still a small issue with the UI though that can only be fixed in Neovim itself (see
[#14735](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14735)).
