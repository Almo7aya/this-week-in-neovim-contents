- [spellsitter merged to core!](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x7k7r7/spellsitter_merged_to_neovim_core/). A
  huge contribution by [@lewis6991] and [@vigoux]. If you did not know, `spellsitter` is a tree-sitter powered spell
  checking mechanism that only checks spells for specified queries. This allows checking only relevant parts such as
  comments or markdown text for spelling errors. ([#19419](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19419))
