- [spellsitter merged to core!](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x7k7r7/spellsitter_merged_to_neovim_core/). A
  huge contribution by [@lewis6991] and [@vigoux]. If you did not know, `spellsitter` is a tree-sitter powered spell
  checking mechanism that only checks spells for specified queries. This allows checking only relevant parts such as
  comments or markdown text for spelling errors. ([#19419](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19419))

Have you ever used `print()` in your plugin code for debugging? This new plugin by [@smartpde] simplifies this use
case - leave log statements in the code and enable them when needed.

Another new plugin by [@smartpde] for picking the recent files with Telescope. Unlike the built-in
oldfiles picker, this plugin also takes into account new buffers opened in the current session.

> `inc-rename.nvim` is a small plugin that lets you preview Neovim `vim.lsp.buf.rename` command as you type (nightly
> only). It will highlight all occurrences of the variable in your buffers as you rename it.

![inc_rename.nvim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40792180/188309667-0d7e8086-ae48-4a25-8b01-df11d229b8c6.png)

`inc-rename.nvim` released a new update which adds proper support for the popular
[dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) plugin that enhances the appearance of Neovim's default
`vim.ui.input`. Now, the new name of a variable will be mirrored in `dressing`'s input buffer as you type in the command
line. There is still a small issue with the UI though that can only be fixed in Neovim itself (see
[#14735](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14735)).
