- [nvim-0.8 freeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/xft3jw/08_feature_freeze_and_preliminary_release_date/)
  (text extracted from the Reddit post by `u/bfredl`):

  As of today, Neovim nighty is entering the feature freeze period for the upcoming 0.8 release. No further features
  will be merged for 0.8, just bug fixes and documentation improvements (and possibly minor adjustments to new
  features/API).

  The preliminary release date for 0.8 is **30 September** (as has been our aim for some time), but might get delayed if
  needed for critical bug fixes to land. As an example, `cmdheight=0` feature recently received a larger change in
  implementation, is expected to need more testing and bug fixes before it is considered to be stable enough for a
  general release.

  The general advice of always updating Neovim nightly together with plugins applies. In particular, `nvim-treesitter`
  and other tree-sitter dependent plugins need to be updated for changes in Neovim core.

This plugin written by [@vigoux] tightly integrates the `fzy` search engine into neovim, to provide a fast and simple UI

This is an update gathering the release of two versions of the plugin: `v0.2` and `v0.3`.

From `v0.2`:

- Labels position is fixed and overlap with the matches like other _jump_ plugins (old behavior is still available via
  an option).
- You can now use `<Backspace>` to delete last characters of the pattern.t
- You can now use `<Alt-Backspace>` to restore the last version of the pattern that has matches.

From `v0.3`:

- An option was added to limit the maximum length of the pattern.
- An option was added to reuse the last pattern.
- A highlight was added to indicate when the next key must be for the label (when using `max_length_pattern`).

- [Reddit v0.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/xdps7p/sjnvim_02_is_out/)
- [Reddit v0.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/xekydc/sjnvim_03_is_out/)
