Nothing much this weekâ€¦ ðŸ¤·

# Neovim Plugin Community updates

> Neovim is full of active plugins. This section is about the community and what is going on.

**Plugins supporting [SemVer](https://semver.org) will have a little badge on the right side of their title:
<span class="has-text-grey">SemVer</span> <span class="icon has-text-warning"><span class="fa-solid fa-star"></span></span>
Those plugins help contributing to a more stable Neovim ecosystem, and hence are put in front of others. Thank you!**

People have been busy butâ€¦ nothing really interesting worth discussing for this week, sadly.ðŸ˜¢
